# aioapi
A WIP Web Framework based on examples found on the internet

## Based on:

- [DIY Async Web Framework](https://github.com/hzlmn/diy-async-web-framework)
- [PyAsynchronous](https://github.com/riki-nitdgp/PyAsynchronous)

At first I try to implement the basic functionality from the examples above with
the end goal being - extend it to something more useful.

## TODO

- [ ] More Powerful middlewares
- [ ] Pluggable integration for pydantic/attrs/Marschmellow 
- [ ] Pluggable database configuration - essentially we don't want to rely on specific ORM
- [ ] Better content negotiation and responses
- [ ] Application template generator
- [ ] Examples of usage
- [ ] Full Unit-Testing and Testing Clients
